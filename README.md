/atlas
fsaverage5_xx_Schaefer2018_400Parcels_17Networks_order.label.gii: The .gii file used as the Schaefer 400 atlas
DPABISurf_Schaefer2018_400_17Networks_v1.mat: the atlas info file
Note: Some regions of this atlas do not belong to any networks, they are excluded. This lead to a tricky issue: the atlas number and the node number are different.
